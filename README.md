play audio from a mp3 file in rust

## How to build 
1. Install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. clone or download this repo
3. run the following in the source directory: `cargo run`

## How to use

as you started the program, it prompts you to provide the full file path of the mp3, yea bruv there is nothing much to explain T_T. 

well after that you can go into the config.json file, and make some adjustments to how the file is being played. you can adjust: the playback speed, the playback volume and the interval time of when the sound gets played again.

**IMPORTANT**

always keep the right format in the json ^^
